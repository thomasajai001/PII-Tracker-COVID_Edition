## How it Works ?

1. Users can register either as a customer or a shopkeeper.
2. Accounts are authenticated by the user's Google acoount or by email. 
3. If validated, customer accounts are initiated by first recording their personal information: name, address, vaccine status and photo, where as shopkeeper accounts are initiated by first    recording the shop's information: shop name, owner's name, address, and photo which is directly to stored to firestore(provided by firebase).
4. Customers when visiting the stores can scan the QR Code which is made available by the shopkeeper through the QR generated by the store's account.
5. As a result, the customer's data is added to the store's list of customers and at the same time, the customers can keep a track of the record of shops visited by them through their accounts.
6. All users at any time can update their information, so that provide the most recent and accurate information.
